### Records
___Info - All the information needed to render a page (changeInfo doesn't have a page or a link).
___Link - All the information needed to render a link to a page

### stuff which needs to be documented
set means unordered,
lists are ordered, e.g. recent events are ordered from most recent to last recent
all lists should also be made unmodifiable inside the record initializer

tests inside apgebuilder mostly jsut check taht they run.
any widget tests will use the root pagebuilder so the html works

css files should be layed out identifially.
